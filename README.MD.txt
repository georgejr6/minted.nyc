Clone or download the React frontend code from the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install or yarn in the project directory.
Open the App.js file in your code editor.
Update the axios.post call in the handleSubmit function to point to the URL of your backend server. For example, if your backend server is running on http://localhost:3000, you would replace /nft with http://localhost:3000/nft.
Customize the form fields and UI as needed to suit the specific requirements of your app.
Run the frontend app by running npm start or yarn start in the project directory.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port your app is running on).
Use the form to upload media and enter location data, and then click the "Mint NFT" button to submit the request to the backend server.
If the NFT is successfully minted, the transaction ID will be displayed in the UI. If there is an error, the error message will be displayed instead.
Implement additional measures to prevent spam or abuse of the NFT minting functionality, as needed. For example, you could add rate limiting, user authentication, or payment requirements to the backend server.
